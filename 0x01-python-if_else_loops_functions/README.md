## 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
Project introduces the concept of C programming

- **Repo:**   alx-higher_level_programming
- **Dir:**    0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions

## Tasks
**Mandatory Tasks**
- 00 -  Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
- 01 - Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
- 02 - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- 03 - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- 04 - Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
- 05 - Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
- 06 - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- 07 - Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
- 08 - Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
- 09 - Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
- 10 - Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- 11 - Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
- 12 - Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
- 13 - Insert in sorted linked list

**Advanced Task**
- 14 - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
- 15 - Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
- 16 - Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c)
